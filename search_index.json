Jourdain (IMR), Olav N. Breivik (NR) and Edvin Fuglebakk (IMR) calendar_today 2019-02-20 The North Sea cod stock assessment is based on indices of abundance-at-age from fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys. The age structure of the catch is estimated by sampling fish for otoliths collection in a length-stratified manner from trawl hauls. Since age determination of fish is costly and time consuming, only a fraction of fish is sampled for age from a larger sample of the length distribution and an age–length key (ALK) is then used to obtain the age distribution. In this study, we evaluate ALK estimators for calculating the indices of abundance-at-age, with and without the assumption of constant age–length structures over relatively large areas. We show that the ALK estimators give similar point estimates of abundance-at-age and yield similar performance with respect to precision. We also quantify the uncertainty of indices of abundance and examine the effect of reducing the number of fish sampled for age determination on precision. For various subsampling strategies of otoliths collection, we show that one fish per 5-cm-length group width per trawl haul is sufficient and the total number of fish subsampled for age from trawl surveys could be reduced by at least half (50%) without appreciable loss in precision.

Fulton (CSIRO) calendar_today 2019-10-24 The marine ecosystem model Atlantis is structured following the MSE framework, meaning Atlantis simulates both the operating model and the management procedure. This is an advantageous feature for simulating MSE under and ecosystem-based context, however it may be cumbersome to program complicated/specific management procedures into Atlantis. To integrate Atlantis into the REDUS framework, Atlantis was programmed to send/receive data back and forth with the statistical software R. With this new functionality, Atlantis can be treated solely as an operating model while R is used to simulate the management procedure. Thus, management procedures previously programmed in R can now be simulated under an ecosystem-based context within Atlantis.

To simply put, GadgetR provides users flexibility to explicitly control gadget simulation steps, and inspect and modify (as needed) gadget internal objects (such as recruitment parameters, fleet consumption amount, among others) at any point in time during the simulation. These functionalities are especially useful when you want to use a gadget model as an operating model (single or multi- species) in existing management strategy (MSE) frameworks in R (FLR/mse or FLBEIA). GadgetR ships with the latest Gadget program (version 2.2.00-BETA) and retains all of the original Gadget program functionality.
